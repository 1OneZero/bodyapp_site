            equal or better star rating or service facilities) to the original booking, in another
            Service Center,

        In view of the above, BODYAPP reserves the right to charge the Business Outlet for the
        inconvenience caused to the Customer ("Inconvenience Charge") along with applicable
        taxes. The aforementioned Resolution Cost and the Inconvenience Charge plus applicable
        taxes shall be adjusted against the Business Outlet's monthly reconciliation amount

        Outlet)

        In the near future, as millions of people book a service through BODYAPP, the experience
        in one Business Outlet can significantly affect the potential business and reputation of all
        BODYAPP Business Outlets. The objective here is thus to minimize situations where either
        the Business Outlet or the customer are at the receiving end of a poor review or
        unsatisfactory customer experience.
