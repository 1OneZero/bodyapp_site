        background verification checks of the Channel Partner in order to authenticate inter alia the genuineness

        We store the information that we receive from Facebook with other information that we collect from you
        or receive about you. Facebook controls the information it collects from you. For information about how
        Facebook may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please
        consult Facebook's privacy policy. We have no control over how any third party site uses or discloses the
        personal information it collects about you.
    </p>

    <h4>3. COLLECTION OF AUTOMATIC INFORMATION, USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES</h4>
    <p>
        We and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks, use cookies, web beacons, and other
        tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Website and Services, such as your
        browser type, your ISP or operating system, your domain name, your access time, the URL of the previous
        website you visited, your page views, your IP address, and the type of device that you use. We also track
        how frequently you visit our Platform and use our Services. We use this information (including the
        information collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to determine
        which portions of our Platform are used most frequently, what our users like/do not like), to assist us in
        determining relevant advertising (both on and off our Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising
        campaigns, and as otherwise described in this policy. Currently, we do not honor browser requests not to
        be tracked. <br>
        We may obtain your device ID, which is sent to BODYAPP 's servers and used in fraud prevention efforts.
        Cookies: We and our third party service providers collect information from you by using cookies. A cookie
        is a small file stored on user's computer hard drive containing information about the user. The cookie
        helps us analyze web traffic or informs you about your use of a particular website. Cookies allow web
        applications to respond to you as an individual, tailoring its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by
        gathering and remembering information about your preferences. When you visit the Platform, we may
        send one or more cookies (i.e., a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your
        computer that identifies your browser. <br>
        Some of these cookies may be connected to third-party companies or websites. The terms of use of such
        cookies are governed by this Policy and the privacy policy of the relevant third-party company or website.
        For example, Google measures the performance of advertisements by placing cookies on your computer
        when you click on ads. If you visit the Website when you have such cookies on your computer, we and
        Google will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. The terms of use of these cookies are
        governed by this Policy and Google's Privacy Policy <br>
        Disabling Cookies: You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable
        cookies you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Website because it may not function
        properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. <br>
        Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies: Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
        in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs
        are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags),
        in connection with our Platform to, among other things, track the activities of Platform visitors, help us
        manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We and our third-party service providers
        also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when
        our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

    <h4>C. Electronic Newsletters, Invitations, Polls and Surveys</h4>

        additional personal information as detailed below:
    </p>
    <h4>1. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS</h4>
    <p>
        We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We will gather the email addresses of users who sign
        up for BODYAPP for the newsletter mailing list. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by
        opting out of receiving newsletters during the registration process, by following the link provided in each
        newsletter that points users to a subscription management page where the user can unsubscribe from
        receiving newsletters or by changing their preferences in their Profile Settings page.
    </p>
    <h4>2. "SEND TO A FRIEND"</h4>
    <p>
        Our Platform users can voluntarily choose to electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone
        else by clicking "send to a friend." To do so, the user must provide his or her email address, as well as the
        email address of the recipient. The user's email address is used only in the case of transmission errors and,
        of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <h4>
        3. POLLING
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see
        what our audience think about important issues, Services, and/or the Platform. Opinions or other
        responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a system to
        "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not
        correlated with information about individual users.
    </p>
    <h4>
        4. SURVEYS
    </h4>
    <p>
        We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content to our Platform users. We
        will not share individual responses from these surveys with any third party. We will share aggregate data
        with third party service providers, partners, and other third parties. We also will post aggregate data
        containing survey responses on our Platform; that data may be viewed and downloaded by other users of
        our Platform.
    </p>
    <h4>
        D. Security
    </h4>
    <p>
        We employ procedural and technological security measures, which are reasonably designed to help
        protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. BODYAPP may use encryption,
        passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against
        unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we
        do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or
        private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against
        unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after
        using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and
        keeping your log-in and password private. BODYAPP is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your
        information or for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via
        unauthorized password activity.
    </p>
    <h4>
        E. Disclosure

    <p>
        We may share the information that we collect about you, including your personal information, as follows:

    <ul> BODYAPP reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary in order to comply with a legal
        process (such as a court order, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirement of any
        governmental authority
    </ul>
    <ul>

        reasonably necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use etc.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        disclosure is intended to help investigate or prevent unauthorized transactions or other illegal
        activities, or

        generated by cookies and aggregate information (collectively, "information") with these vendors and
        service agencies. For example, we may provide your information to a credit card processing company to
        process your payment. The vendors and service agencies will not receive any right to use your personal
        information beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you. If you
        complete a survey, we also may share your information with the survey provider; if we offer a survey in

        will include the details of your request, including your location, and other contact details. Interested
        bidders, however, will be able to click on your request on such third-party site, and will be directed to our

        service provider on our Platform interested in bidding on your request.

        of all or substantially all of BODYAPP 's assets to which this Platform relates or other corporate
        reorganization in which BODYAPP participates, and is thus merged with or acquired by a third party entity
        (a "Successor"), BODYAPP hereby reserves the right to transfer the information we have collected from
        the users of the Platform and/or Services to such Successor.
        In addition, in the event of BODYAPP 's bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the
        benefit of creditors, or the application or laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally,
        BODYAPP may not be able to control how your information is transferred, used, or treated and reserves

        BODYAPP is not responsible for the content of such external websites. We are not responsible for the

        your preferences page in "Edit Profile." You must promptly update your personal information if it changes
        or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very difficult

        your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible based on your Account activity and
        in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply
